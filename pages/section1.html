    <p>ðŸ‘‹ I'm Omar! I am a senior student at NYCCT in the Electrical Engineering of technology department, I have extensive experience in hands-on projects, compiling written reports.  Moreover, my work experience as an electrician required extensive time management and collaboration efforts, preparing me for the deadlines and team demands. Some of  my relevant experiences include: Coordinated with other contractors and trades to ensure smooth workflow on projects. Read blueprints for assigned work projects. Analyze, design, and test circuits.
